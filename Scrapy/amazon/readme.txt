Findings:
- The section looking like the item name is not actual the full item name.
- The very last section appearance is based in the sorting selection
- {https://www.amazon.com -predictable}/{a section of item name -not predictable}/{product-reviews -predictable}/{ASIN number -predictable}/{determined by sort selection-\ we dont have to worry about it anyway.}
