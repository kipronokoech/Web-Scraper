Getting information on this mess was like pulling teeth. Two different supervisors assured me this would be fixed within an hour or two, and both said they would call me back. Neither did.

Recently, our rent payment unexpectedly did not go through. I got an email saying it was canceled due to technical problems. I called my bank, who said there was an error on Zelle's side, but I could not attempt to re-send the rent because, despite the fact that it never went through, it was saying I had reached my monthly sending limit. The representative from my bank said she'd try to see if Zelle would let her override this limit, given their error. Zelle did not allow the override. I had to go in person to my landlord's bank to deposit my then-late rent to their account directly. Now, this month, Zelle double-paid my rent! It doesn't show this under Zelle activity, but I confirmed with my bank that it was sent twice. I could have been overdrafted. AND, of course- I could not request via Zelle the extra payment back from my landlord directly because the amount was over the *requesting limit*! What absolute garbage.

I was supposed to receive nearly $1000 in a transfer from my old landlord. It\u2019s obvious what happened, but zelle will not help with the issue. This is because their customer service is pretty much non-existent and designed to get you to deal with the bank. If you call their support number, nearly every option leads to them telling you to wait 72hrs or contact your bank. Well, after 72hrs and my bank asking me to contact zelle, the person at zelle still won\u2019t help. The money is supposedly gone. Landlord won\u2019t give more money because it\u2019s already out of his account. Both banks don\u2019t have the money, because it has already been sent from the sending bank, but was never received by my bank. Zelle is still EXTREMELY unhelpful.

That money has not appeared anywhere. I have been in contact with XE numerous times to try and find out what happened, and, after the first 26 days, to ask for a recall of the funds back to my Canadian bank account. Two weeks and two days after that, I receive an email telling me they are closing my file, and that I should reach out to my bank here in Costa Rica to find my own money. One month and twelve days, and this is now my problem. The amount of money in this transaction is not huge by some standards, but to my wife and I (both retired) it is significant. To say that we are extremely anxious, frustrated and angry is an understatement. As a side note, my bank here in CR says that they do not accept International Transfers in Colones. Only in US dollars and Euros. Something you would think that XE would know from the start. Right now, if I could give less than one star!!!!!"},

My last transfer in August took 4 days for some reason and I was unhappy. However this transfer transaction occurred at 04.15 GMT with the funds received into XE\"s account  some few minutes later  - day 1 and to my surprise the funds transfer took place immediately and were in my own bank in Singapore on day 2.

I looked them up online and it turned out they scammed many others (onlinethreatalerts: article: is-dreamkis-vip-a-scam-see-the-review-of-the-online-store) with the same 'deal'.  Others who had been scammed turned to PayPal and some said they received a refund and got to keep the cheap tennis ball.  At this point I turned to PayPal to deal with the fraudulent seller.  PayPal wanted me to RETURN the tennis ball to the vendor and provide a tracking number.  I thought this ridiculous and took it to the post office expecting to lose about $10 for shipping which I would have done on principle.  The post office wanted $70 to send the tennis ball to the vendor with tracking.  Of course I did not ship the ball and PayPal closed the case due to my not providing a valid tracking number.

I decided to use Western Unions online money transfer and wow what a complete waist of time, I spent several hours over the course of two weeks trying to send the money, they site is terrible, not intuitive, they do not explain how the transfer works, the exchange is a complet joke, my transefers never got approved. Called and talked to a rep to fix the issue, \"i am sorry we are working on issues on the site\" this was the excuse every time. DO NOT USE WESTERN UNION they may be the oldest in the business but the are old and their systems are not working. A friend told me to use remitly instead, and guess what, super easy, fast, intuitive, no issues, everything well explained and you can even transfer the money into the receivers bank instantly, and guess what? much cheaper then Western Union."},

Just trying to save a few bucks instead of sending through paypal took me so much trouble instead. I sent my payment on 8 Oct and I had to continuously contact the customer service and helpline regarding why the transaction has not been sent yet. I would say it took me more than 5 hours in total. The chatbox would automatically close for no reason. One time, when I contacted the customer service, they asked me to send my selfie to confirm my identity. Yet on their website and the initial email, there was NO PLACE to send the selfie. On 12 Oct, when I contacted the customer service for probably the 4th or 5th time, they asked me to call my bank to confirm if my transfer has been made and not held on for security purposes. I called, there was no issue and my transaction went through on 9 Oct. On 13 Oct, I found out that my transaction was cancelled on their part. Its ridiculous how long I had to wait for the transaction to BE CANCELLED. They did not give me any reason for the cancellation. I had to spend time to once again for the 6th time, call the customer service to ask why and they said MAYBE it was because of the late sending of selfie, and they actually couldn't confirm why it was canceled. Hello, why didn't you inform me to send the selfie immediately if that was the problem from the start? I would have sent on the day of my transaction. It's ridiculous how they allow you to send them money to their bank account but do not allow you to transfer money since they have not \"identify your identity\". So what was the solution? They asked me to order another transaction and pay them the fee AGAIN. They said the previous transaction will be refunded to me in 3 to 7 working days. Do I trust them to order another transaction and pay again? No. If I do not receive my refund in 7 days, I would consider contacting the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)."},

Remitly collects the transfer fees and promises to send the money immediately. Just a few minutes after making the transfer Remitly asked me to upload the ID of the recipient. Due to the time difference between China and France, I sent the photo of the document the next day, Tuesday 22nd. At that point I asked the customer service via chat (it is not possible to contact them by phone) if everything was ok but they told me that they could not read the document because it was in Chinese. So it became ridiculous because it is obvious that a Chinese person's identity document is written in Chinese. Remitly pretended that my friend had a passport. In the end Remitly accepted the document in Chinese but told me that the expiry date was missing. I asked my friend for the photo on the back of the document and today I sent it to Remitly. Customer service assured  me that the transfer will be processed immediately. After two hours the transfer has not yet been processed so, once again, I contactEd customer service who told me that the document is still under review because they do not see the date of birth. Please note that the date of birth is on the third line of the document and that the numbers are written with the same characters as ours. I was hoping to have solved the problem and finally see my transfer processed but no, they ask me to wait again because the verification team is reduced ( why???) and therefore there are delays. But the commission money is collecting them.... The last update is that Remitly wrote me that they can\u2019t process the transfer because my friend Alipay account hasn\u2019t complete setup . That\u2019s ridiculous......What a terrible experience, never again"},

Also they should have account that will send smaller amounts each month year out. You can purchase currency & be ready for vacation. In the country you have to deal with currency exchange & I personally found, some times you get what you pay for & sometimes you do not. The hotels with currency exchange are the most fare, but you will spend more to convert the currency. Reproable hotel will give you proper amount with less chance of them skimming from the exchange. Exchanges on the economy, in some places if they give you  the rate, take moment and do the math. Cell Phone or watch calculator, see they try to skim the money, even the change.

{"stars": 1, "review_title": "I WILL NEVER, EVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN.", "review_body": "I have very occasionally used WU outlets over the years to transfer modest amounts to friends experiencing difficulties in other countries and I'd had no real problem with their service.  In July my 92 year old aunt who had been unable to go to church because Covid closed it told me she wanted to send her saved 'alms offerings' to someone deserving.  After a discussion she decided she wanted to send her \u00a3100 to a driver we'd befriended in Egypt because he'd had very little work since the tourist trade had greatly decreased.  I said it was a simple process to send money via WU and, as she is housebound and has no computer, I offered to send it on her behalf so she gave me her \u00a3100 cash and added \u00a35 for the \"postage\".   I am in the 'shielding' category against Covid because of my own serious health issues so used my laptop to send my aunt's full \u00a3105.  The WU site said the transaction had been sent, was waiting for pickup and gave me the MTCN which I texted to the recipient.  He went to the WU outlet but discovered that the WU site had only sent it to HALF of the name I had typed in and therefore did not match his ID.   The WU shop where he was waiting asked me to resend the request which I did.  It arrived in minutes with his full name and a different MTCN so he collected it.  When I got my credit card statement I saw BOTH transactions had been taken from me including the one in only half of the recipient's correct name which could never be collected by anyone.  After hours on the telephone with utterly unhelpful WU agents covering more than two months and 54 'Groundhog Day' repetitive, unhelpful email exchanges from equally unhelpful Customer Advocates to try to get them to refund the patently erroneous transaction, I had an email saying the refunded money had 'not been collected' so I broke shielding and went to a WU outlet using the original MTCN they'd given me but which I told them I couldn't collect because I couldn't leave the house.  When he logged in, the man in the shop said the transaction was showing 'Suspended'.   After another round of repetitive emails I received an apology and a different MTCN.  In the past week, I've  had to visit three different WU outlets on six different occasions - \"system down\"; \"WU man gone to the Cash and Carry shop 30 miles away\"; \"unable to process WU now as we haven't used it for months\"; \"shop closed down\" etc.  This morning, I finally received back, in cash, the modest \u00a3105 plus the \u00a34.50 fee.   The pleasant enough man in the one room WU grocery shop outlet told me that WU were rubbish.  I had to agree with him.  I have wasted hours on phones or emailing since July and only one on line agent was ever helpful. In the end I had to put myself at risk by going against shielding guidelines to source an open WU outlet with a functional system in this area of high Covid incidence and additional constraints.   I will never, ever use Western Union again."},

I attempted to send money to my relatives in the Caribbean, all of \u00a33000. I paid for direct deposit which would take 0-1 business days. The money left my account immediately. Its coming up to 2weeks and the money has not been deposited.  Several calls to Western Union and I am promised a call back or told that the money would be available the following day. I explained that my relatives were in dire need of the money and that my mom was ill, I just wanted it released. The response was \"please tell your family member we are working on it \", or a simple sorry that seemed forced I have no extra cash to send and they have put me in a huge jam. The agents do not grasp English, they don't understand what is required and say yes when they should say no or vice versa. There is no accountability. Its frustrating. Spoke to several managers, no one does nothing or do what they promise. They escalate to several none existent departments, promise follow up calls,  fake resolution times and nothing happens. I have spoken to so many managers, I still cant believe they were managers they had no authority, empathy and did not help . So many promises of a resolution yet my money is still in limbo. I have never asked for a refund because my family needs the money.  Yet today I get an email that I will be refunded in 5-7 business days!!  So in total they would have taken my money for 3wks and chances are the refund will not be within the time given based on other reviews here. I rang just now requesting the money to be deposited, only to be told that the receiving bank declined the transaction and I should wait 5-7 working days for my refund. I rang the bank and they denied this (I knew WU wasn't being truthful). I had already informed the bank that the transaction was coming days in advance. These excuses that they give after taking your money is crazy. Its soo frustrating!! I only used Western Union because of the direct deposit option as Money Gram doesn't have this feature and I didn't want that kind of money being sent via a cash point. Its the biggest mistake I ever made. I stopped using WU last year and I am reminded why. I will stay far and I suggest everyone does too. Western union why do you offer a service that is none existent? 0-1 business days and nothing ! They are we quick to take your money. Im tired of hearing sorry. Its sad that a well known company is doing this. I will stay far and I suggest you do too. Operator ID 307&062 and did not assist and they were managers. At no point was I rude to these people as I've worked in Customer care and I just wanted a resolution. Each call made me feel as though I would be treated as a valued customer but then its the opposite. Save yourself the disappointment, spread the word. DO NOT USE WESTERN UNION BANK DEPOSIT!

I pointed out to them that this was n=an urgent situation and I needed the money delivered.  The guy in Ghana kept going to the bank, and they knew nothing of the transaction.  I finaly got a message back from this company that they decided to cancel my transaction, and refund the money to me (within 22 days),  It was paid for by visa,  I sent them my drivers ID from British Colombia, I sent then a phot of myself.  Then they decided to just cancel the transaction after 4 days of no delivery.  I have now read the reviews and there are several others with the same problems.  I can not believe that this company is still in business.  Just to let you know, I am helping a family out in Ghana who are going through some very rough times, and they needed the money to pay for malaria medicine, and for some food.  They have no job because of the Covid situation there.  I was also told that my ID was not good enough,   Then they had the nerve to tell me they do not have to disclose why they decided to cancel my account.  This company is in my eyes one that should be put out of business.  Their registration should have asked for all of the ID out front, leaving no doubt that they will do the job.  But to request more ID after 2 days, when it should have been delivered in 4 hours is unacceptable.  They are wondering still why I got angry with them ... incompetency is not acceptable.  I certainly will encourage others no to use this company."},

I confirmed this change as \"correct\" and sent the $. Easy enough almost 2000.00 out of our account in seconds. I alerted the contractor the $ was forthcoming. I received a text from the him stating the money has been sent to the wrong account (as shown in his text message from Zelle). Unknowingly, his cell number was linked to his father's bank account out of state. Upon reading the text regarding the forthcoming deposit, the contractor had the option to accept, or reply STOP or HELP . He replied STOP, then HELP without any further reply on Zelle's end, and the deposit went through. When he realized his cell number was linked to his father's account, currently frozen, he attempted to stop the wire. Unfortunately, his dad is in a nursing home dying of covid and the contractor does not have access to his father's account. I have sent an email to Zelle, I have called the bank, the contractor has called the bank and there is NO WAY to reverse the deposit without taking legal action.

I provided all the info requested by Xoom making sure the name written( 4 very long first names) was exactly the same as the recipients government ID which needed to be used for collection. Both myself and my friend received texts and emails confirming each stage of the transaction. My friend went to his local bank in Trincomalee this morning and produced the reference number along with his ID. He received the full amount in LKR currency no problems. I paid \u00a33.99 for the cash collection and rounded the cash up. The exchange rate was pretty close to the google rates give or take a few pence. Maybe transfers to a bank account may be different I haven\u2019t tried. All I wanted to do was send cash to a local who has no PayPal account.

The money arrived quickly, and was deposited in the correct account.  Xoom does a great job keeping you informed of the status of your transfer by email every step of the way. I later transferred larger amounts and the only delay I experienced is when Xoom had to verify that the checking account I was transferring from was my own.  I didn't really mind that, as it tells me there are working safeguards built into this service. The speed of the transfer is incredible, about as fast as PayPal. Xoom makes it quick and easy to send money. They even have an option to buy minutes for your phone, which is very helpful and convenient.  I've read a lot of negative reviews here, but judging from my own experience, I have to believe that many of the problems are self-induced by the user.

She gave me another number to call which I called immediately. The 3rd agent told me that it was fine and to go to the cashier and pay the $300, which I did. When the recipient of the money went to pick it up in Jamaica, they told her that there was a hold on the account. I then had to call another number. I was on hold for 2 and 1/2 hours on two different phones and never got the problem resolved. The next day I called to cancel the transaction. They put me on hold for another hour and a half. I got so frustrated I hung up and called later in the day. I was on hold for another 2 hours. This is where I'm at now. I just want to cancel the transaction. They keep on telling me that the transaction is up for a review with their customer service department but nobody at customer service will answer the freaking phone. I'm still trying to cancel the transaction. Do not use this service. There was no reason for my transaction to be flagged in the first place and what is the point of customer service if they don't answer the phone for their customers?"},

My neighbour has a business account and on his contact us page he has all the means of getting in contact including a call us option. If you're not on a business account that call us option is not available. So if you don't pay them by having a business account they're not interested and will ignore all communication.

I got emails saying to se d the buyer money through zelle , that was so my account could be upgraded. So as he was helping me he needed to see where I sent the money to zelle , then we proceeded to do \u201cdummy accounts\u201d the first one he had it reversed instantly, so there were a few more and as we talked and tested the system 3 transactions didn\u2019t get \u201cvoided\u201d. Then we moved to my cash app so they could pay me in full and apply it there . I was instructed to put money on my account and delete my cards and put in a gift card number (which he provided) while we are doing this he is going from one screen to the next , I paid out the amount on cash app because it was all going into my account right ? Hell no !!! Then as I continue to question the money that wasn\u2019t \u201cvoided\u201dor \u201creverses\u201d  he said he would have to call me back In the morning because the banks are closed and can\u2019t get any transactions to go through !!

They both went to get money at different agencies - and one was told , there is no transaction on the tracking number provided, the other was told there is a transaction but it needs to be activate. So I called WU to find out why ? All they told me, they will contact me via e-mail for me to send my ID for them to verify , then after that in 24hr/48hrs, my receivers will be able to collect the money. I found it a joke, first of all why they never contacted and waited for my receivers to go and collect money while they did say money was ready. I ask to for both n to be cancelled, the customer service replied their department can\u2019t cancel it because the money is on hold, so they connect me to another department- I was on hold for 2 hours, the then department, did what they supposed to do, and told me as well, they will conne t me to another department, after being on hold for a while again , the phone went down. I called again - this time the customer service asked me to go to the the shop, I went to the shop, they couldn\u2019t cancel - because WU hold the money. I called the customer service again , and I asked to send an e-mail. I researched about that e-mail I found it a joke but sent the e-mail. I called again the customer service so now , I asked to speak to a manager and told him what is wrong with your service ? All I want is cancellation of my refund,  so I can use RIA transfer Money, so he\u2019s calling the right department himself and I\u2019m still on hold for 2 hours so far.

I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I tried again. Same error with no explanation. I logged in this morning to try again, same error so I called customer service. They couldn't really tell me what the error code was but told me I needed to call my bank. They also told me my profile was  ineligible (?) and is going to be shut down. I called my bank and they told me they saw a transaction try to come through last night and it was rejected because of mismatched expiration date. I call zelle back with my information and they tell me my profile has already been shut down. I told them this was BS. I used them once it was fine, used them twice and they boot me off their app!! Yet they still have my debit card info. They wouldn't delete my profile. They just told me it was inactive. Oh best of all is that they told me that if I get a new phone and phone number, then I could download the app and use it again. What \"real\"company does this??"},

First of all it\u2019s very clear that they offer extremely low exchange rates. but another problem that i have realized recently is THEY ALWAYS DELAY YOUR TRANSFER. everytime you send money WU sends you an email after an hour that your identity or blah blah blah (random unnecessary stuff) is needed to complete transfer. Literally everytime they would delay your transfer. Yesterday i have sent money through WU and they sent me email that your transfer has been stopped temporarily. i contacted them via telephone and i was told that everything is fine it\u2019s only an automatic email, we will start processing your transfer and now it\u2019s been more than 15 hours that my transfer is still in progress.

Zelle has no consumer protection from scamming and offers no solutions for outright fraud.

The problem is that wu is official what I used not fraudulent website or anything, but later realised after some research! wu can find any reason to postpone your transfer as they play with your money around, they picked up a random number of customers and use their money for other purposes (play here and there for investment). If they take the money immediately why cannot refund it same speed? that is how they make money! Is a complete gamble fraudulent monetary system please do not use it or similar ones.

Never before have I experienced such a difficult process in order to verify anything. Customer service is primarily AI operated making the process even further infuriating.

I bought a reborn doll from the Chinese,hadn't realised it was coming from china to begin with of course the doll came only made to look like the one they advertised, different clothes completely different features random hair looked nothing like the doll advertised. There was no way I was going to present this to my daughter on Xmas Day! So opened a despute (not as descripted) seller sniderly offered \u00a330 partial refund! They know what there doing...declined the offer! I just wanted full refund so I could go purchase another from a verified retailer as I should of done in the first place so then Seller offered full refund if I send the doll back and upload tracking which as then I will get the full refund! I complained about this under the consumer rights act 2015 as the seller is obliged to pay for return postage costs if an item is not as described and they did not give 2 f**** seriously they said i know what ur saying but to get a full refund you need to send it back! I got quoted \u00a333 from myhermes and \u00a345 parcelforce \u00a352 DHL ect so was basically backed into a corner.

When I made the purchase, PayPal suggested to pay with my PayPal account so I would have Buyer's Protection.

The seller sent a mirror for a totally different car which, of course, did not fit and could not connect to the electronics of my car. When I tried to return the mirror, the seller requested for it to be sent to INDIA, even though he had shipped it from Utah, USA. To send the item to INDIA would cost way more than I paid for the item. Additionally, the address provided did not even look like a legitimate address. Long story short \u2014 PayPal has not helped in this matter at all. They have come up with more and more outrageous requests what I have to do to get a refund: sending the item back to India which would cost about $100 for the $50 part, then when it gets returned because the address is fake, show them the receipt, filing a report with the FBI, getting an official letter from the post office showing that the address is fake,(impossible to get) etc. etc. The buyer's protection is obviously more of a seller's protection. With a policy like this, the seller can use PayPal to send whatever they want, get paid, and then leave the buyer with no recourse for reimbursement, and no repercussions for the criminal seller's action. I have communicated with PayPal for over 3 months now, and they are not willing to do anything at all. Please be ware, if you use PayPal, the Buyer's Protection is completely useless.

I'm using your service and you are hurting me. I understand the dispute may made by his bank, but the problem is, you are the company providing service to help both side, you risking department should control and take responsibility for it. In the transaction, i did nothing wrong, I have no idea he was paying me with credit card since Paypal is protecting the information, so how come I should be the one take the lost. imaging if I know he is paying with a credit card instead of a debit, I may think this could be a stolen cc or something else, then I will stop the transaction. Since Paypal is in the middle of the transaction, you should take responsibility to both side, not hurting me so hard only because his bank decided to take money back from Paypal. Did I do something wrong? NO! or the only thing i did it wrong is used your service? If I receive  the money with my bank directly, no one can take that from me even there is a dispute.

They said they couldn't give me a full refund unless I sent their product back to China, the cost of which would have been astronomical.  I turned the matter over to PayPal who did an \"investigation\".  After a month of waiting you know what their conclusion was?  I could get my money back if I sent it back to the company.  They didn't even allow me to respond.  It was either accept or close the complaint.  Wonderful way to do business.  Suffice it to say, I will not be using PayPal anytime in the near future."},

{"stars": 1, "review_title": "PayPay Buyer Protection - think again before you use PayPal.ugust 2020", "review_body": "Back in August 2020 - I fell for a Facebook posted scam purchase and since I thought that I would be protected - used PayPal to make the payment.  All seemed well as I received an email confirmation shortly after the purchase and later a tracking number.  Although alarmed by the Chinese tracking number - I figured that I would let it ride through and see what happened.  After the usual 2 plus months of checking the status of the shipment from China - I finally was surprised to see that the shipment was on it's way.  When my package arrived - it dawned on me that when I saw the cheap, substitute merchandise that I received instead of what I had ordered - I knew that I had been scammed and shame on me.  I immediately contacted PayPal and started a claim on the purchase and was asked to tell my side of the story in detail.  PayPal advised that they would contact the seller.  The Chinese seller replied back to PayPal that I had indeed ordered from them - but that I actually ordered the cheap junk that they sent me and that I had gotten what I ordered - which was dead wrong.  When advised of the seller comments - I immediately contacted PayPal by phone (which consisted of waiting in line for over 45 minutes) and when I finally reached a PayPal rep - I was told simply that the case was under review and no further assistance could be offered at this time.  I waited at this point - figuring that PayPal would refund my purchase price after figuring out that this was obviously a scam seller and all would be well.  I then received a notification from PayPal that I would be required to return the merchandise to the seller in China - that I would be required to pay the return shipping and that I would need to enter the tracking information in the resolution center by October 8, 2020 or my case would be automatically closed and I would not be issued a refund.  I again contacted PayPal and after waiting the approximate 45 minutes listening to the endless recorded messages.  This time the PayPal rep told me that they would email the seller - but if no response was received - I would still need to return the merchandise at my cost and enter the tracking number or forfeit the case.  PayPal would not send me an email confirmation of this conversation for my records as well.  I did receive a follow-up message notification from PayPal - after I had no alternative but to message PayPal - this message reintegrated the original PayPal contact that they were only responsible for refunding the purchase price and that they recommended that I contact the seller for a prepaid shipping label to return the cheap substituted merchandise which wasn't worth returning at any cost.  I replied to PayPal that I had little chance - if any - of getting any response from a Chinese scammer for a return label before the end of time and certainly not before October 8, 2020 so that I could enter a tracking number to preserve my active status of my case.  The whole point here is that my experience with PayPal is that they are not interested in protecting the buyer who obviously made a bad purchase and they could care less about any buyer protection whatsoever in respect to the business they generate with these fraudulent sellers.  I have made it very clear to PayPal that this will have been my last purchase using PayPal and that I have already contacted my credit card company to file a dispute with PayPal for this practice.  I have spoken to our credit card company, started a claim and uploaded any and all documentation on this purchase.  I am reviewing my experience with PayPal here for the benefit of others who may want to think twice about using PayPal thinking that they will have any buyer protection in cases such as mine.  I freely admit that the purchase mistake was mine and lesson learned - but I have also learned that PayPal is not a trustworthy company and that they have probably the worst customer service department that I have ever contacted."},

After a month they concluded that they deny my claim because the item that had not been delivered to me 'was delivered to me' (contrary to all the evidence).

No wonder the seller laughed at me when I tried to reason with them and asked for my order to be finally delivered - they must have known that PayPal got them covered. Canceling my account and switching to using just credit cards and two of the very well-known PayPal competitors (which I have also been using for a long time and without any problems).

This is out of order and the biggest scam of ever heard of I will be reporting PayPal and the seller to watch dogs and I hope they close a company down. I will advise whoever wants to use PayPal do not as you will lose your money and waste your time. I am only doing this to warm people because I have gave up and I will be speaking to the ombudsman about this through my bank this is out of order and an unacceptable in this day and age it's supposed to be trusted online not a scam from both companies the seller and PayPal are working together as the seller as I explained earlier was a UK seller but instead of them returning it to the UK the seller is asking me to send it to Hong Kong that would cost the same price I paid for the item.

Customer service unhelpful knowing that most of the branches are closed and difficult to find one. They will not help you to access your money.
